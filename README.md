- 👋 Hi, I'm @haneytron
- 👀 I'm interested in .NET (Core!), asynchronous programming, low-level performance and related algorithms, concurrency issues, thread safety, and search problems (heuristics and syntax).
- 🌱 I'm currently using .NET 9, Azure, and the Discord API as well as brushing up on latest Elasticsearch / Lucene and OSS LLMs.
- 💞️ I'm always happy to take PRs for any of my public projects!
- 📫 How to reach me: [My Blog](https://www.davidhaney.io), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidahaney), or [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@haney).
